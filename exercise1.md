1.	For python linting can be done using Pylint package or Flake8 package, testing can be done using Pytest package and installing dependencies can be done using the pip package installer.
	
2.	Alternative CI options beside Jenkins and Github actions are: 
•	CircleCI (https://circleci.com/)
•	Travis CI (https://www.travis-ci.com/)
•	Buddy (https://buddy.works/)
•	CodeShip (https://www.cloudbees.com/products/codeship)
•	Bamboo (https://www.atlassian.com/software/bamboo)

3.	Most likely a cloud-based solution would be the best because it is easy to set up compared to a self-hosted service and more simple to work with especially with a team of 6 people and only one project because it allows the team to focus more on developing the product instead of creating and monitoring the self-hosted service which takes plenty of time, most likely small and medium sized teams do not need a self-hosted service but if the project needs a GPU for more complex tests or you need to do something a bit more complicated that cloud solutions just do not allow, then a self-hosted service might be the better options but in most cases especially for small and medium sized teams a cloud-based solution is the better option. Important details in choosing a setup are for example programming language, packages used in the project and complexity of the project.
